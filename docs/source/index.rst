DXT Explorer
===================================

DXT Explorer is an interactive web-based log analysis tool to visualize Darshan DXT logs and help understand the I/O behavior of applications. Our tool adds an interactive component to Darshan trace analysis that can aid researchers, developers, and end-users to visually inspect their applications' I/O behavior, zoom-in on areas of interest and have a clear picture of where is the I/O problem.
